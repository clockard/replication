            This is for a vulnerability in zookeeper 3.4.13 coming in through the spring-data-solr artifact.
            This is not an issue for replication because the solr cloud configuration is not used which is where
            zookeeper is used.

            This is for a vulnerability in jackson-databind 2.9.9 coming in through the spring-data-solr artifact.
            This is not an issue for replication because we don't expose any json endpoints at this time.
